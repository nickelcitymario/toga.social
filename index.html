		<h3>The Missing App</h3>
		<p>You’ve been there. You’re on your journey of sexual discovery, and it feels like there should be an app for finding people just like you. But instead you find a mess. The community is a diaspora finding connection in groups on Facebook, where we’re monitored, our content monetized, and our expression censored. Many of us have found refuge on Fetlife, which is an incredible place, but find we’re reduced to 1-dimensional expressions of ourselves: our kinks. Reddit is outstanding for online connection, but not so great for making IRL connections. And our experience with dating apps don’t allow us to express our full identities and don’t support forming true communities.</p>
		<p>Toga is different. We’re taking all the things that work from that disparate array of apps, getting rid of the crap that doesn’t work, and putting it together into a safe place where we can connect, find true community, build relationships, support one another on our personal journeys, and find connection in its many forms, whether it be friendship, friends with benefits, monogamy, polyamory, ethical non-monogamy, relationship anarchy, or anything in between.</p>
		<p>We believe that you are perfect just the way you are and deserve to be celebrated, supported, and loved for who you are. We’re looking forward to meeting you - the real you.</p>
		<h3>Current Stage: Early Development</h3>
		<p>Toga is now under active development. We've gotten some great feedback from the community, validating there's a real need for this app. But it's still early days and there's still plenty of time to give us your feedback! Check out the links below for the concept, feedback form, and our links on socials. In particular <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TogaSocial/">Reddit</a>, where we're active every day.</p>
		<p>What we've discovered is that today's dating app scene is horrendously broken. It's so much worse than we thought. The profit-motive of today's dating apps are driving them to make terrible anti-user decisions, and people are demanding something better. We hear you and we're working on it as fast as we can.</p>
